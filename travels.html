        <h2>Countries I've Visited</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to explore a variety of beautiful destinations across the globe. 
            Each country has left me with unforgettable experiences, and here are some of the highlights from my travels:
        </p>

            <h3>1. Italy</h3>
            <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/W7xBMooTKm4JRstd4jojSYBoEqY=/0x0:7952x5304/fit-in/792x528/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2020/03/24/559/n/45101125/06c61ac25e79fc30a64224.30513518_.jpg" alt="Italy">
            <p>
                Italy holds a special place in my heart for its rich history and incredible architecture. 
                From walking through the ancient streets of Rome and visiting the Colosseum to getting lost in the canals of Venice, every corner of Italy tells a story. 
                The culture, the food, and the art—whether it's Michelangelo’s work in Florence or the Vatican's grandeur—make Italy a truly unforgettable destination.

            <p>
                France has always captivated me with its elegance and charm. Exploring Paris, from the Eiffel Tower to the cozy cafés along the Seine, was like stepping into a romantic film. 
                The southern coast, with its breathtaking Mediterranean views, offered a perfect balance of relaxation and adventure. Whether enjoying croissants in the morning or wine tasting in Bordeaux, every moment in France was filled with beauty and pleasure.

            <p>
                Switzerland's natural beauty is unlike anywhere else. 
                I had the chance to hike in the majestic Swiss Alps, where every view looked like a postcard. 
                The clean air, the shimmering lakes, and the towering mountains left me in awe. 
                I especially loved visiting Jungfraujoch, one of the highest points in Europe, where the views of snow-capped peaks stretched as far as the eye could see.

            <h3>4. Sri Lanka</h3>
            <img src="https://thesrilankatravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/beach.jpg" alt="Sri Lanka">
            <p>
                Sri Lanka is a paradise of vibrant culture, stunning beaches, and ancient history. 
                My journey took me to serene temples, lush tea plantations, and golden beaches that seemed to stretch forever. 
                The warmth of the locals, combined with the island’s unique blend of nature and history, made Sri Lanka one of the most memorable places I’ve visited. 
                The country’s wildlife, especially the elephants in national parks, added even more magic to the experience.

            <h3>5. Singapore</h3>

            <p>
                Singapore amazed me with its perfect blend of futuristic architecture and lush green spaces. 
                The towering skyscrapers, like Marina Bay Sands, contrast beautifully with the natural beauty of Gardens by the Bay. 
                I enjoyed wandering through its diverse neighborhoods, sampling the local street food in bustling hawker centers, and admiring the city’s commitment to sustainability and innovation. 
                Singapore is truly a city where tradition meets the future.
